# ChatBuddy

ChatBuddy is a very simple XMPP chatbot which aims to help you talk through
whatever is on your mind. It was built as part of the Project Ginsberg #lifedesigns
Hack Weekend.

ChatBuddy depends on sleekXMPP which can be installed by pip:

    pip install sleekxmpp

You can then run chatbuddy like this:

    python chatbuddy.py

Then, add the chatbuddy@jabber.org account to your jabber/xmpp/gchat account and
chat away!
